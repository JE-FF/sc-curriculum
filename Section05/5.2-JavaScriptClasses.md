## **Objective: -**

In this module we'll look at ...

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Methods and `this`
- Creating Objects with `function` Constructors
- Creating Objects with the class Keyword
- Inheriting Behavior with the `extend` Keyword
- Seven more handy JavaScript methods

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Organizing code structures around _Objects_ rather than _functions_ is called **O**bject-**O**riented **P**rogramming (**OOP**).

As we've seen already, Objects can have keys which are Strings, and values which can be any data type: Strings, Numbers, Arrays, Objects... even functions!

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Pat",
  location: "St. Louis",
  age: 33,
  hobbies: ["working", "partying"],
  pets: [
    {
      type: "dog",
      name: "Jack",
      age: 10,
      breed: "Pit mix",
      rescue: true,
      goodBoy: true,
      bark: function bigBark() {
        return "Ruff";
      },
    },
    {
      type: "dog",
      name: "Gilbert",
      age: 2,
      breed: "Mini Aussie",
      rescue: true,
      goodBoy: true,
      bark: function littleBark() {
        return "Yap, yap, yap";
      },
    },
  ],
  party: function throwParty() {
    return "Dance, dance, dance!";
  },
};
```

## Methods and `this`

In the example above, `party` and `bark` are a `function`s. If a `function` is attached to an _Object_, we refer to that `function` as a **method**.

While it's perfectly valid to declare the `party` method as above, we can also use a shorter syntax:

```javascript
const person = {
  // other properties here
  party() {
    return "Dance, dance, dance!";
  },
};
```

We can call this method by invoking `person.party()`. But what do methods give us besides a bit of organizational and semantic clarity?

One of the big benefits of attaching methods to Objects is access to the _calling context_ (or parent Object) of that method through the **`this`** keyword.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Pat",
  // other properties and methods
  greet() {
    return `Hi, my name is ${this.name}`;
  },
};
```

`this` is a tough concept in JavaScript, but the thing to remember is that `this` refers to the _calling context_ - or parent Object - of a `function`. In the example above `this` refers the the Object `person`.

What if a function was in the _global context_ and accessed `this`? Try declaring this regular `function` in the global scope:

```javascript
function logDefaultContext() {
  console.log("this is: ", this);
}
```

In the example above, `this` references the global `window` Object in the browser or the `global` Object in Node.

### Activity 1: `this`

## Creating Objects with `function` Constructors

Object literals are fine as long as we're dealing with a single object/thing.
Often, however, it is more useful to create a **category** of objects/things in order to _share properties and methods_ among Objects of the same type. **`function` constructors** are used as a kind of "_template_" for a _category_ of things instead of, like Object literals, just creating a specific _instance_ of a thing.

`function` constructors are conventionally _capitalized_ to help them stand apart from "regular" functions. Like any other function, just _declaring_ the `function` constructor doesn't actually call or invoke the function. _Unlike_ other functions, to invoke a `function` constructor we must use the `new` keyword.

```javascript
// declaring the function constructor
function Person(name, age, interests) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.interests = interests;
  this.bio = `${this.name} is ${
    this.age
  } years old. They like ${this.interests.join(", ")}`;
  this.greet = function() {
    return `Hello! I'm ${this.name}`;
  };
}

// using `new` to create an instance of Person
const pat = new Person("Pat", 35, ["movies", "cats"]);
const mack = new Person("Mack", 31, ["music", "baseball", "TV"]);
```

<br>

### **The `Object.prototype`**

If we `log` `pat` and `mack`, we see that they _share properties_, but have _different values_ for those shared properties. We **also** see that they _share methods_, but that those methods are _exactly the same function_ for each instance.

It is _unnecessary and wasteful_ for each instance of Person to "carry around" the same set of methods. It is more idiomatic for each instance to **inherit** its methods from a **prototype**.

To set a property/method on a prototype, simply chain `.prototype` on the end of your `function` constructor. With our `Person` constructor above, we should have attached our methods like this:

```javascript
Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  return `Hello! I'm ${this.name}`;
};
```

Declaring methods this way frees your instances from having to "carry around" its methods.

But what is `prototype` and why can it "carry" properties/methods for instances/Objects?

<br>

### **Inheritance**

In this instance you should think of a family tree. Parents have traits that are passed on to their children. In addition, a parent controls the environment that the children operate in.

A class can therefore be thought of as a parent. The children inherit information from the parent class. As anyone with siblings (or children) can attest, not all of the child objects behave the same. This is where the idea of <b>prototype<b> comes in. The method that a child inherits can be altered using prototype. Or, if need be, an entirely new method can even be added.

Each object has a _private property_(`__proto__`) which holds a link to another object called its **prototype**. That prototype object _has a prototype of its own_, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. By definition, null has no prototype, and acts as the final link in this **prototype chain**.

When trying to access a property/method of an Object, JavaScript will **first** check for that property on the Object itself, however, if it fails to find the property, it **then** checks for the property on the Object's _prototype_ (then _that prototype's prototype_, _and so on..._ until it finds the property or reaches the _end_ of the prototype chain).

To learn more about inheritance and `prototype`, explore the [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain).

<br>

### **"Overwriting" `prototype` Properties**

Because JS checks the _Object itself_ for a property **before** checking the `prototype`, we can "overwrite" a `prototype` property/method _for that particular instance_ by declaring it on the instance directly.

> **NOTE**: We are not _actually_ overwriting the `prototype` property. When JS starts searching for the property on the Object, it finds that property name on the Object itself, so it never checks the `prototype`. We could think of it as a kind of "short-circuiting" the `prototype` property.

```javascript
Person.prototype.dance = function() {
  return "Dance, dance, dance";
};
pat.dance(); // returns "Dance, dance, dance"
mack.dance(); // returns "Dance, dance, dance"

// this "overwrites" the dance method for Pat
pat.dance = function noFun() {
  return "I don't dance.";
};
pat.dance(); // returns "I don't dance"
mack.dance(); // returns "Dance, dance, dance"
```

### Activity 2: `function` constructors

[5.2.2-MoreFunctionConstructors.md](Activities/5.2-Activities/5.2.2-MoreFunctionConstructors.md)

<br>

## Creating Objects with the `class` Keyword

For decades, Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript was built around `function` constructors and direct `prototype` modification. This worked, but was very cumbersome to write and maintain when compared to other programming languages. To make OOP a bit easier for web developers, JavaScript now has a **`class` keyword** that allows us to re-write our `function` constructors and `prototype` methods, combining them in the same scope/"package".

A class is a template for creating objects. Inside the object that you create, code is written that allows you to work with the object data. This code is written inside curly brackets and is known as the body of the class.

```javascript
// "class" syntax
class CategoryName {
  constructor(param1, param2) {
    this.property1 = param1;
    this.property2 = param2;
  }
  method1() {}
}
```

### **Declare a Class**

To declare a class, simply use the `class` keyword and the class name followed by some braces ( `{}` ) that define the _scope_ of the `class`.

<br>

### **The `constructor()` function**

The _first_ thing inside the class's scope will be a **`constructor()` function** that effectively takes the place of our `function` constructors. Like `function` constructors, the `constructor()` function takes a number of arguments that will be used to populate the properties of the Object using the `this` keyword.

<br>

### **The function methods**

_After_ the `constructor()` function, we declare any and all **methods** that we want to attach to the class's `prototype` Object.

To create an **instance** of the `class`, use the `new` keyword and the class name, exactly like `function` constructors.

```javascript
// using the class keyword to declare a class/category
class Person {
  // the constructor function looks and acts similar to the function constructors we have been working with
  constructor(name, age, interests) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.interests = interests;
    this.bio = `${this.name} is ${
      this.age
    } years old. They like ${this.interests.join(", ")}`;
  }
  // properties/methods outside of the scope of the constructor function attach to the Person prototype
  greet() {
    return `Hello! I'm ${this.name}`;
  }
  dance() {
    return "Dance, dance, dance";
  }
  // end of Person scope
}

// creating instances of the Person class
const pat = new Person("Pat", 35, ["movies", "cats"]);
const mack = new Person("Mack", 31, ["music", "baseball", "TV"]);
```

<br>

### **Inheriting Behavior with the `extend` Keyword**

A major benefit of the `class` keyword is the ability to **`extend`** a class, _adding to the `prototype` chain_ and allowing new classes to _inherit behavior from classes_ they `extend`.

```javascript
// "extends" syntax
class SpecificCategory extends CategoryName {
  constructor(param1, param2, param3) {
    super(param1, param2);
    this.property3 = param3;
  }
  method2() {}
}
```

To declare an **`class` extension**, use the `class` keyword and the class name followed by the `extends` keyword and the class you want to extend. Again, braces ( `{}` ) define the _scope_ of the `class`.

The _first_ thing inside the class's scope will be a _`constructor()` function_ that effectively takes the place of our `function` constructors. The **first** thing _inside the `constructor()` function_ will be a **`super()` function** that calls the _`constructor()` function_ of it's _parent/extended class_. We pass the "general"/shared parameters that are not specific to the `class` extension into the `super()` function.

_After_ the `constructor()` function, we declare any and all **methods** that we want to attach to the class's `prototype` Object.

To create an **instance** of the `class` extension, use the `new` keyword and the class name, exactly like `function` constructors and `class`.

```javascript
// using the extends keyword to declare a class/category that extends the prototype chain of Person
class Teacher extends Person {
  constructor(name, age, interests, subject) {
    // the super function calls the constructor function from its parent class (Person)
    super(name, age, interests);
    this.subject = subject;
  }
  // this greet method "overwrites" Person's greet method
  greet() {
    return `Hello! I'm ${this.name}, and I teach ${this.subject}`;
  }
}

// creating an instance of the Teacher class
const jo = new Teacher("Jo", 61, ["art", "camels", "boats"], "art");
jo.greet(); // returns "Hello! I'm Jo, and I teach art"
jo.bio; // returns "Jo is 61 years old. They like art, camels, boats"
```

## Additional JavaScript methods

We have learned a few String Methods and several Array methods, but there are 100's more methods that can help make our JavaScript coding life easier.

Here are some more handy Array methods to know:

### **1) `some()`**

The some() method tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the callback function. If passed, ‘true’ is returned, otherwise ‘false’.

```javascript
  // Definition:
  arr.some(callback(element[, index[, array]])[, thisArg])

  // Example:
  const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

  // Is at least one element greater than 4?
  const numA = arr.some(num => num > 4);
  console.log(numA); // output: true

  // Is at least one element less than or equal to 0?
  const numB = arr.some(num => num <= 0);
  console.log(numB); // output: false

  // Is any element larger that 5?
  const numC = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].some(item => item > 5)
  console.log(numC);  // output:  false

```

### **2) `every()`**

The every() method is in a way similar to the some() method, but it tests whether all the elements in the array pass the test implemented by the callback function.

```javascript
  // Definition:
  arr.every(callback(element[, index[, array]])[, thisArg])


  // Example:
  const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

  // Are all elements greater than 4?
  const greaterFour = arr.every(num => num > 4);
  console.log(greaterFour); // output: false

  // Are all elements less than 10?
  const lessTen = arr.every(num => num < 10);
  console.log(lessTen); // output: true

  // Is Every element larger that 5?
  const a = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6].every(item => item > 5)
  console.log(a); // output: true

  const b = [7, 6, 5].every(item => item > 5)
  console.log(b); // output: false

```

### **3) `filter()`**

The filter() method creates a **new array** with all the elements that pass the test implemented by the callback function.

```javascript
  // Definition:
  arr.filter(callback(element[, index, [array]])[, thisArg])

  // Example:
  const array = [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

  function isPrime(num) {
    for (let i = 2; num > i; i++) {
      if (num % i == 0) {return false};
    }
    return num > 1
  }

  console.log(array.filter(isPrime)); // output: (6) [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
  console.log(array);  // output...
  (17) [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

---

  const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

  // Return all item(s) greater than 3
  const filtered = arr.filter(num => num > 3);
  console.log(filtered); // output: [4, 5, 6]
  console.log(arr); // output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

```

### **4) `includes()`**

The includes() method determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning true or false. Note that the method includes() is case-sensitive when comparing strings and characters.

```javascript
  // Definition:
  arr.includes(valueToFind[, fromIndex])

  // Example:
  const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
  arr.includes(2); // output: true
  arr.includes(7); // output: false

  console.log([1, 2, 3].includes(2)); //  output: true
  console.log([1, 2, 3].includes(4)); //  output: false

```

### **5) `fill()`**

The fill() method changes all the elements in an array to a static value, from a start index (default 0) to an end index (default array.length). The updates will happen in place and will return a reference to the same array.

```javascript
  // Definition:
  arr.fill(value[, start[, end]])

  // Example:
  const original = [1, 2, 3]
  const result = original.fill(4)
  console.log('original', original); // output: (3) [4, 4, 4]
  console.log('result', result); // output: (3) [4, 4, 4]
  console.log(original === result); //  output: true

```

### **6) `reverse()`**

The reverse() method reverses an array in place. By reversing we mean that the function will transpose the elements of the array, the first element will become the last, and the last the first element. This operation **will mutate** the original array and return a reference to the same.

```javascript
  // Definition:
  arr.reverse()

  // Example:
  const a = [1, 2, 3];
  console.log(a); // [1, 2, 3]

  a.reverse();
  console.log(a); // [3, 2, 1]

```

### **7) `sort()`**

The sort() function is very common and simply allows us to sort the elements of an array in place and returning the sorting array. The default sort order is ascending. The complexity and performance of this method cannot be guaranteed as it depends on the implementation.

```javascript
  // Definition:
  arr.sort([compareFunction])

  // Example:
  const numbers = [4, 2, 5, 1, 3]
  numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b)
  console.log(numbers); //  output: (5) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

---

  const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
  const alpha = ['e', 'a', 'c', 'u', 'y'];

  // sort in descending order
  descOrder = arr.sort((a, b) => a > b ? -1 : 1);
  console.log(descOrder); // output: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

  // sort in ascending order
  ascOrder = alpha.sort((a, b) => a > b ? 1 : -1);
  console.log(ascOrder); // output: ['a', 'c', 'e', 'u', 'y']

```
